# Blackhole
As a team, we decided to work on a covid game that is specifically directed to kids that otherwise can't just understand covid through learning but rather through games. According to studies, we have seen the impact games have in the lives of children. The game is an informative game where children will not only learn about covid through our educative game but also mix with other children around the world.
